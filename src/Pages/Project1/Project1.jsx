          <p>This is what I'd call my capstone project. It is broken down into multiple versions and deployments, and will ultimately be a multi-user, public application utilizing a database. I want to work outside of my comfort zone and create something that makes me grow my skills.<br/><br/>

          <br/><br/>
          The idea for this project came from me, as a service dog handler, not being able to remember which businesses (particularly restuarants) I've visited were a good experience. Version 1 of this application allows users to capture information about the business and add a personal note regarding the comfort and safety of their service dog when visiting.
          <br/><br/>
          Version 2 will incorporate the Google Maps API and Pocket Base database.

          <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
          <p>This project really required me to be organized with my file structure, which in turn kept me organized in the execution. <br/><br/>
          I liked learning about local storage and the print function. I can see these being useful in many other applications. <br/><br/>
          I appreciated that my understanding of how to pass functions and attributes to children components really came together through this project. <br/><br/>
          I stepped away from this project for a few months, and when I returned, I was able to read through and understand the code base and how it was functioning. I think this is largely due to having clean, readable code that is well-labeled.</p>
          <h2>Future Enhancement Ideas</h2>
          <p>I'm actually planning another project like this where I create the conference agenda with some sort of library to display it visually in a more calendar-like format. This will make it easier to tell which talks happen at the same time, and even visually distinguish the locations of the talks. <br/><br/>
          I'd also like to add a "share" button in addition to printing. <br/><br/>
          Another idea would be to add "add to calendar" options so users could put the talks directly onto their own personal calendar (google, etc).</p>
