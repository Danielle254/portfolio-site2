      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h4>Once an engineer, always an engineer.</h4>
      <p>With a background in mechanical engineering, small business ownership, and technical training, I've always been a problem solver. Now, I'm bringing all of that experience to frontend web development.<br/><br/>
      I built websites for my small businesses for many years using Wix. I'm fascinated with why people do what they do, and that includes using a website.<br/><br/>
      I'm passionate about accessibility and inclusion, and I'm on a mission to make digital spaces more welcoming and easy to enjoy.<br/>
